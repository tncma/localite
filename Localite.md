##Team/Project Name: 
###Localite

##Team Members:
1. Karthik Muthukrishnan - Freelancer, Chennai <br/>
2. Venkata Krishna Chaitanya Mannem - NBOS technologies, Hyderabad <br/>

##Problem: 
1. There is a communication gap between the government officials and public. <br/>
2. For better governance public should also contribute and communicate effectively within the neighbourhood which is reducing a lot due to current lifestyle. <br/>
3. Any government related announcement for a particular locality is a pain. Mostly communicated through word of mouth. <br/>
4. Datasets and current redressal system not user friendly. Enabling APIs for these sites would open up great opportunity for developers and third party applications. <br/>

##Solution: 
1. Provide a platform where users will be able to follow specific areas which they prefer to. <br/>
2. Government can make important announcements and notifications to the users based on the area. Eg. Dengue alert, Aadhar registration. CCTP page in facebook is a great example for the response from public. <br/>
3. An effective platform for social reporting on civic services. Complaints registered to existing redressal system through APIs. <br/>
4. Dashboard for both public and government to view trending complaints and governance effectiveness. <br/>
5. For Analytics, Government can view the dashboard at ward, zone, district and state level. <br/>
6. Public to actively communicate with neighbourhood to track what's happening and create awareness. <br/> 
7. Opportunity for local and small business/vendors to reach the public. <br/>
