##Team/Project Name: 
###Localite

##Team Members:
*Karthik Muthukrishnan - Freelancer, Chennai
*Venkata Krishna Chaitanya Mannem - NBOS technologies, Hyderabad

##Problem: 
* There is a communication gap between the government officials and public. 
* For better governance public should also contribute and communicate effectively within the neighbourhood which is reducing a lot due to current lifestyle.
* Any government related announcement for a particular locality is a pain. Mostly communicated through word of mouth.
* Datasets and current redressal system not user friendly. Enabling APIs for these sites would open up great opportunity for developers and third party applications. 

##Solution: 
*Provide a platform where users will be able to follow specific areas which they prefer to. 
*Government can make important announcements and notifications to the users based on the area. Eg. Dengue alert, Aadhar registration. CCTP page in facebook is a great example for the response from public.
*An effective platform for social reporting on civic services. Complaints registered to existing redressal system through APIs. 
*Dashboard for both public and government to view trending complaints and governance effectiveness.
*For Analytics, Government can view the dashboard at ward, zone, district and state level.
*Public to actively communicate with neighbourhood to track what's happening and create awareness. 
*Opportunity for local and small business/vendors to reach the public.
